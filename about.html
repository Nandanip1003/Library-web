                <h3>LIBRARY</h3>
                <p>
                    Our library is a state-of-the-art facility, designed to meet the academic needs of students from all
                    disciplines. We have an extensive collection of books, journals, magazines, and other materials
                    covering
                    various fields of study, including engineering, sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Our
                    collection is
                    regularly updated with the latest publications, ensuring that our students have access to the most
                    current
                    and relevant resources.

                    Our library is staffed by experienced librarians who are always available to help students find the
                    resources they need. They provide guidance on research methods, help students navigate the library's
                    online
                    catalog and databases, and assist with any other queries related to library services.
